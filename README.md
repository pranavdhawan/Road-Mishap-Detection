There is full-size statistical proof that points to driver drowsiness as a main cause of road accidents all over the world. Driving for prolonged intervals of time can lead to accidents if rest is no longer taken. Drowsiness is an important purpose of vehicular accidents.


## Abstract 

The Detection of Road Mishaps project aims to develop a comprehensive system for detecting and preventing road accidents. The project utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create three essential modules: Speed Calculator, Gas Detection, and Crash Detection. By combining these modules, the project aims to improve road safety by providing real-time data and alerts to both drivers and authorities, facilitating proactive measures to prevent mishaps.
